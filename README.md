# LT84 TimeSync

This is a simple timesync app for the LT84 keyboard without using the keyboard software.

## Build instructions
Requires GCC and HIDAPI. Windows, Mac, and *BSD are currently not supported (you're welcome to open pull requests).

Run `make` and you'll find `lt84_timesync` in the same directory.

## Usage
Connect the keyboard over the USB cable, run the binary and look at the display on the keyboard.
